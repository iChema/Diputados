# Legislatura

A project that was developed in a Hackaton "Hack Bajío e-gov". 

The project objective is to have the inclusion of the whole society 
in the life of the government to have a closer relationship and so 
along with the rulers can make the best decisions together and have 
a steady progress in our community.
